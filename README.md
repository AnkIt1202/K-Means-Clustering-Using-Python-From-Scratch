# Learn how to implement K-Means-Clustering-Using-Python-From-Scratch

### **Problem Definition**

Perform K-Means Clustering on a dataset containing shopping details of customers from various cities to understand how clustering segregates the data similar to each other.

### **Dataset Description**

The dataset is based on the the shopping details of customers of few cities. The data has been populated randomly and holds no such relation to any real systems data or confidential data. It has 8 dimensions or features with 200 entries.

The Attributes are:

>* CustomerGender
>* CustomerAge
>* CustomerCity
>* AnnualIncome
>* CreditScore
>* SpendingScore
>* CustomerCityID

### **Tasks to be performed**


>* Importing Required Libraries
>* Analyzing the data
>* Understanding K-Means
>* Implementing K-Means from Scratch
>* Implementing K-Means using sklearn library
